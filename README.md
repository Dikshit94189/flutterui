i got issue when i create new branch 

1 . DO NOT CREATE BRANCH FROM THE GITHUB 

CREATE BRANCH FROM THE ANDROID STUDIO

AND IN THE configuration WHERE FLUTTER LOGO SHOWS AT THERE ADD MAIN.DART FILE PATH 

issue is i do not find main.dart 

if not resolve with configuration then check modules in the file -> project





/// from this WE SELECT OUR PROJECT

Right now I see in your Modules list:

flutter_ui

flutter_ui_android

But Android Studio hasn’t attached your Flutter lib/ folder as a content root. That’s why in the Project panel you only see .gitignore, pubspec.yaml, etc.

✅ Fix Steps
1. Add the missing content root

In that Project Structure → Modules → flutter_ui, click + Add Content Root.

Select your flutter_ui folder:

C:\Users\diksh\Downloads\flutterProjects\flutter_ui


After adding, mark the lib/ folder as Sources.

2. Ensure Android Studio knows it’s a Flutter project

Go to File → Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Flutter.

Check Enable Flutter support for flutter_ui.

Set Flutter SDK path (should be like C:\src\flutter).

3. Refresh Project

Click File → Invalidate Caches / Restart → Invalidate and Restart.

After restart, open the dropdown (left panel above .gitignore) → select Project.

Now you should see:

android/
ios/
lib/
test/
pubspec.yaml
